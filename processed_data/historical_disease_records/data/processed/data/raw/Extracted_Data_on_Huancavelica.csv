Rainfall,"Irregular rainfall patterns due to climate change, affecting potato growth.","Cañaypata, Huancavelica","Identification of Elite Potato Clones with Resistance to Late Blight Through Participatory Varietal Selection in Peru, p.13",Rain variability impacts both growth and disease prevalence.
Humidity,High moisture retention in soils; humidity influenced by irregular rain.,"Cañaypata, Huancavelica","Identification of Elite Potato Clones with Resistance to Late Blight Through Participatory Varietal Selection in Peru, p.10",Humidity levels correlate with late blight outbreaks.
Weather Anomalies,Frequent frost and occasional hailstorms impact crop yield.,"Cañaypata, Huancavelica","Identification of Elite Potato Clones with Resistance to Late Blight Through Participatory Varietal Selection in Peru, p.4",Hailstorms are less frequent but highly destructive.
Climate Change Impact,"Climate change leads to temperature fluctuations and irregular rainfalls, increasing late blight outbreaks.",Huancavelica,"Identification of Elite Potato Clones with Resistance to Late Blight Through Participatory Varietal Selection in Peru, p.13",Climate shifts have exacerbated late blight prevalence.
Late Blight Severity,Frequent and severe late blight outbreaks; resistance is a top selection criterion.,Huancavelica,"Identification of Elite Potato Clones with Resistance to Late Blight Through Participatory Varietal Selection in Peru, p.4",Severity requires selecting highly resistant clones.
Late Blight Timing,"Outbreaks coincide with cool, humid conditions during flowering and early tuber development.",Huancavelica,"Identification of Elite Potato Clones with Resistance to Late Blight Through Participatory Varietal Selection in Peru, p.4","Cool, moist conditions during critical growth stages drive outbreaks."
Potato Varieties,"CIP308478.59: resistant to late blight, good taste, low glycoalkaloid content.","Cañaypata, Huancavelica","Identification of Elite Potato Clones with Resistance to Late Blight Through Participatory Varietal Selection in Peru, p.1","Selected for flavor and resilience, despite frost impacts."
Potato Varieties,CIP308486.355: high yield but elevated glycoalkaloid levels due to frost stress.,"Cañaypata, Huancavelica","Identification of Elite Potato Clones with Resistance to Late Blight Through Participatory Varietal Selection in Peru, p.19",Frost stress increased toxicity levels in tubers.
Potato Varieties,INIA-303 Canchan and Yungay: susceptible to late blight but adapted to highlands.,"Cañaypata, Huancavelica","Identification of Elite Potato Clones with Resistance to Late Blight Through Participatory Varietal Selection in Peru, p.7","Preferred for market, despite susceptibility to disease."
Planting Dates,"Planting begins in November, with harvest 120 days later (typically March).","Cañaypata, Huancavelica","Identification of Elite Potato Clones with Resistance to Late Blight Through Participatory Varietal Selection in Peru, p.5",Planting aligned with regional rainfall patterns.
Soil Type,Likely loamy or clayey soils with high moisture retention; prone to compaction in cold.,"Cañaypata, Huancavelica","Identification of Elite Potato Clones with Resistance to Late Blight Through Participatory Varietal Selection in Peru, p.10",Moisture retention critical for plant health in high altitudes.
Moisture Levels,Irregular rainfall affects soil moisture; frost contributes to stress.,"Cañaypata, Huancavelica","Identification of Elite Potato Clones with Resistance to Late Blight Through Participatory Varietal Selection in Peru, p.15",Rainfall irregularity necessitates adaptable varieties.
Fungicide Application,Mancozeb applied before hilling to protect susceptible varieties.,"Cañaypata, Huancavelica","Identification of Elite Potato Clones with Resistance to Late Blight Through Participatory Varietal Selection in Peru, p.5",Effective for basic control but insufficient in extreme conditions.
Cultural Practices,"Proper spacing, timely weed and pest control, crop rotation, and use of disease-free seed.","Cañaypata, Huancavelica","Potato Late Blight Information, p.2",Integrated approach helps manage disease beyond chemical control.
Effectiveness of Practices,Environmental factors like frost reduce fungicide effectiveness; stress increases glycoalkaloid levels.,"Cañaypata, Huancavelica","Identification of Elite Potato Clones with Resistance to Late Blight Through Participatory Varietal Selection in Peru, p.19",Frost stress reduces effectiveness of fungicides.
