Aspect,Details,Factors Influencing,Extraction Date
Morphology,"Coenocytic mycelium, lemon-shaped sporangia (29x19 to 36x22 µm), thick-walled oospores (30-56 µm).",Temperature and humidity affect sporangia formation and zoospore activity.,2025-02-04
Life Cycle,Asexual: Sporangia germinate into zoospores or germ tubes. Sexual: A1 and A2 mating types produce oospores.,"Cool, moist conditions favor sporangial germination; warm, dry conditions halt the life cycle.",2025-02-04
Genetic Variability,"Variation through sexual reproduction, mutations, and parasexualism; characterized using RFLP and SSR markers.",Presence of both A1 and A2 mating types increases genetic diversity and resistance development.,2025-02-04
