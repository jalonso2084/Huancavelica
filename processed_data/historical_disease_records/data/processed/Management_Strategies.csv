Control Type,Methods,Advantages,Disadvantages,Extraction Date
Genetic,"Use of resistant varieties with horizontal resistance (e.g., CIP392634.52).","Environmentally friendly, reduces chemical dependence.","Pathogen can adapt, limiting long-term effectiveness.",2025-02-04
Chemical,"Application of contact (copper-based) and systemic fungicides (metalaxyl), with antiresistance strategies.","Effective for rapid control of outbreaks, both preventive and curative.","High cost, environmental risks, and potential for resistance.",2025-02-04
Cultural,"Crop rotation, proper planting time, timely foliage removal, and proper storage practices.","Cost-effective, lowers initial inoculum and disease pressure.","Requires continuous monitoring and planning, not always sufficient alone.",2025-02-04
Biological,"Use of antagonistic microorganisms like Bacillus spp., Trichoderma spp., and garlic extracts.",Sustainable and eco-friendly with minimal health risks.,"Field effectiveness can vary, limited commercial availability.",2025-02-04
