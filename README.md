🥔 Huancavelica AI-Powered Late Blight Prediction Model 🌍



🚀 Predict potato late blight outbreaks using AI!

This repository provides an AI-powered model to help farmers and researchers analyze weather, soil, and farming practices to determine disease risk levels in Huancavelica, Peru.

📂 What's Inside?



AI Model: A Random Forest model trained to predict late blight risk using weather, soil conditions, and farming practices.

Python Scripts:

predict.py: Runs predictions on input data and saves results to predictions.csv.

train.py: (Optional) Retrains the model with new data.

Sample Data: Example weather and soil data in CSV format for testing.

Jupyter Notebooks: Notebooks for data exploration, model training, and feature importance analysis.

References: A list of scientific papers used for model training and evaluation (see REFERENCES.md).

💡 CSV Formatting Tip: Make sure your CSV file is comma-separated and doesn’t contain extra spaces or missing values.



🔍 Run Predictions on Your Data

bash

Copy

Edit

python scripts/predict.py --input your_data.csv

🔮 Understanding the Output

The predictions.csv file contains:



Latitude Longitude Predicted Risk

-12.0433 -77.0283 High

-13.1631 -72.5450 Medium

✔ Low Risk: No immediate action required.

✔ Medium Risk: Consider preventive measures such as adjusting irrigation or applying fungicides as a precaution.

✔ High Risk: Immediate intervention recommended, including applying fungicide within the next 3 days.



🧠 How Are Risk Levels Determined?

The risk level is based on the predicted probability of a late blight outbreak.

If the probability > 70%, the risk is classified as High.

If the probability is between 40-70%, it is classified as Medium.

If the probability is below 40%, it is classified as Low.

📌 Note: These thresholds are based on historical outbreak patterns and may be adjusted as new data is collected.



🚀 Future Improvements

✅ Improve model accuracy using hyperparameter tuning (Grid Search, Bayesian Optimization).

✅ Incorporate deep learning models (e.g., LSTMs for time-series forecasting).

✅ Develop an interactive web app using Streamlit or FastAPI.

✅ Expand the model to other crops affected by similar diseases.
